<h1> Summer Vacation! </h1> 

<h2> Buffalo, New York  </h2> 
  
<p> This summer I visited Buffalo, New York for the first time. This is my mom and grandmother's home, and this year they were hosting
     our annual family reunion. This was the farthest our family reunion had been from home, so 9 others including the 3 in my family 
     imediate family loaded into a van made the trip. When in Buffalo I visited 3 places that i thought was interesting Niagara Falls, 
     The Nash House, and the Museum of Color Musicians Club. </p> 

<h3> Niagara Falls </h3>

<p> When I was at <a href="https://www.niagarafallsstatepark.com/">Niagara Falls</a> my family and I took pictures. We did not bring our passports, so we could only take go to the American
     side. I was upset about not being able to visit the Canadian side though, because my family members who live/visited the Canadian side
     says that the veiw was better. We also bought souvenirs like the tourist we were. </p>

<h3> Nash House </h3> 
 
<p> After visiting Niagara Falls our tour bus took us to two museums in Buffalo. One of which being the <a href=" http://www.nashhousemuseum.org/history.html"> Nash House</a>. 
     The Nash House was a museum in order to commemorate the life of <b> Rev. J. Edward Nash </b>. He was a pioneer in the African-American community during the first 50
     years of the 20th century, which lead him to be reveared and his house being turned into a museum. </p>
